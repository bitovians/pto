# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Developing Locally

We will need to install mkcert and run it to generate a local certificate. This is necessary because Freshbooks requires a secure connection to redirect to.

### Installing mkcert

- open terminal on your mac
- run `brew install mkcert`
- run `mkcert -install`
- run `mkcert localhost`

The This will generate two pem (localhost.pem and localhost-key.pem) files in your home directory.

- create a `/certs` folder in the root of the project and copy and paste the two pem files into it

### Running the backend

Clone the [pto-api repo](https://github.com/bitovi/pto-api) and follow the instructions in its README to run the backend.

### Running the frontend

To get the app working locally, update the `.env` file with the following:

```
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

__Don't commit these changes or you will break the deployed app.__

Run the following to start the frontend:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Navigate to: [https://localhost:3000/pto](https://localhost:3000/pto)
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
